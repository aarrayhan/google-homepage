# Google Homepage (Clone)

This project is about building a static Google Homepage with **HTML** and **CSS**. I have used mostly *Flexbox* to align elements.

## Limitations in my skills that I found:

1. Can't use <ins>image as CSS background</ins>. So the workaround was to use images in HTML. This was the most challenging thing to do.
2. Need to work on <ins>margins and padding</ins>.
3. Need to work on <ins>box-shadow</ins>. Used properties from actual Google homepage to create shadow effects.
