This project is about building a Google Homepage with HTML and CSS.

This project used mostly Flexbox to align elements.

Limitations in my skills that I found:

1. Can't use image as CSS background. So the workaround was to use images in HTML. This was the most challenging thing to do.
2. Need to work on margins and padding.
3. Need to work on box-shadow. Used properties from actual Google homepage to create shadow effects.
